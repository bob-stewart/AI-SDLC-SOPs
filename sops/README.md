# 📄 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

This directory contains the canonical library of **Standard Operating Procedures** for the AI-IRB governed AI-SDLC. These documents define the authoritative controls, roles, and responsibilities required to ensure every AI model and feature is developed and deployed with ethical integrity and regulatory compliance.

## 🗂️ Library Structure

The SOPs are organized into thematic series based on a four-digit family code:

- **1000–1009**: **Core Governance & Program Management**
  - Project management, document control, procurement, and IRB engagement.
- **1010–1020**: **Lifecycle & Monitoring**
  - Site monitoring, feature decommissioning, and model lifecycle oversight.
- **1030–1055**: **Security & Requirements**
  - Requirements definition, security administration, and computer system controls.
- **1060–1061**: **Service Levels & Incidents**
  - SLAs and incident tracking/escalation.
- **1100–1101**: **Training & Knowledge**
  - Training documentation and handover procedures.
- **1200–1220**: **Engineering Operations**
  - Development, Quality Assurance (QA), and Deployment protocols.
- **1300–1306**: **Ethical & Regulatory Oversight**
  - Bias/Fairness evaluation, Explainability, Data Protection, and Ethical Risk assessment.
- **2000–2002**: **Quality Records**
  - Control of quality records and audit evidence.

## 🚦 Navigation & Usage

1.  **Start with the Index**: Refer to [SOP-LIST-01-AI](SOP-LIST-01-AI_AI-IRB-Governed-AI-SDLC.md) for a high-level summary of every procedure in this library.
2.  **Follow the Visuals**: Every SOP has a corresponding visual workflow in the [../diagrams](../diagrams/README.md) folder. Look for matching SOP identifiers (e.g., `SOP-1004-01-AI`).
3.  **Governance Gates**: Most SOPs include mandatory "Gate Sign-offs" from the **AI-IRB**. Ensure these are documented in your project's quality records as prescribed.

## 📝 Document Conventions

- **SOP ID**: Unique identifier in the format `SOP-####-##-AI`.
- **PlantUML**: Many SOPs include embedded PlantUML sources for their respective sequence diagrams.
- **Relative Links**: Images in these documents refer to high-resolution assets in the `../diagrams` directory.
