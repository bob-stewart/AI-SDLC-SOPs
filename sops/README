# SOP library

The `sops` directory contains the canonical AI-SDLC Standard Operating Procedures. These Markdown documents define the controls, responsibilities, and review cycles required to govern AI-enabled solutions across their lifecycle.

## File organization
- **Individual SOPs (`SOP-####-##-AI_Title.md`)** – Authoritative narratives that describe each process from initiation through closure, including roles, required records, and escalation paths.
- **Index files** – When present, these provide curated tables of contents to help you navigate large SOP collections.

The four-digit family code groups SOPs by discipline (for example, `1000`-series documents cover program management and governance, while `1300`-series documents focus on ethical oversight). Use the shared identifiers to match procedures with the diagrams found in [`../diagrams`](../diagrams/README).

## Using the SOPs
1. Identify the SOP that matches your activity or compliance requirement by scanning file names or search keywords within this directory.
2. Follow the prescribed steps, ensuring all listed inputs, approvals, and outputs are captured in your project artifacts.
3. Consult the corresponding diagram to visualize the workflow and confirm that responsibilities are clearly assigned.
4. Record any organization-specific tailoring in change logs or complementary documents so the base SOP remains a stable reference.
