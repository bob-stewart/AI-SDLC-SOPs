**SOP-1054-01-AI\_**AI-Regulated-Project-Approvals-and-Sponsorship  
**Title:** AI-Regulated Project Approvals and Sponsorship

![][image1]

## **Objective**

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a structured methodology for obtaining approvals, sponsorship, and oversight of AI-related projects within the organization. It defines the steps, responsibilities, and deliverables required to ensure thorough evaluation by relevant stakeholders—most notably the AI-IRB (AI Institutional Review Board)—and alignment with strategic, legal, and ethical standards.

## **Scope**

This SOP applies to all AI-related projects requiring corporate approval, budget allocation, or strategic sponsorship. It encompasses new projects, major enhancements, incremental updates, and pilot programs where AI-based solutions are developed or deployed. All employees, contractors, or partners engaged in these AI projects must adhere to this SOP before requesting official project approval or sponsorship.

## **Applicability**

* **All Project Managers** leading or proposing an AI-related project.  
* **Product Development Teams** (technical or business-focused) who plan to incorporate AI or advanced analytics.  
* **AI-IRB Liaison** and **Governance** bodies responsible for compliance, risk assessment, and final approval.  
* **Senior Management** or **C-level Sponsors** who sign off on project feasibility, budgeting, and resource allocation.

## **Related Documents**

* SOP-1051-01-AI (Security Administration for AI systems)  
* AI-SDLC Master SOP (overarching AI development life cycle)  
* Organizational Policy on Ethical AI Usage  
* Procurement SOP (if external AI services are required)

## **Procedure**

Below are the major steps, arranged in chronological order, to ensure robust project approval and sponsorship for AI initiatives:

1. **Initiate AI Project**  
   1.1. **PM** researches project feasibility, potential ROI, scope, and resource requirements.  
   1.2. **Product Development** clarifies user requirements, technical possibilities, and business objectives.  
   1.3. **PM** compiles AI Project Approval Packet with the following sections:  
   \- Business justification and ROI  
   \- Technical feasibility  
   \- Preliminary risk assessment, including **recursive self-improvement subroutine consistency**  
   \- High-level timeline and cost estimates  
2. **Preliminary Review**  
   2.1. **PM** and **Product Development** collaborate on refining the packet.  
   2.2. **AI-IRB Liaison** is consulted if the AI solution triggers known ethical or compliance concerns.  
   2.3. **Legal and Compliance** does a quick regulatory and legal check for high-level feasibility.  
3. **Submission to Sponsor / Senior Management**  
   3.1. **PM** formally submits the AI Project Approval Packet to the **Sponsor** (could be Senior Management or an executive sponsor).  
   3.2. **Sponsor** evaluates alignment with corporate goals, resource availability, budget constraints, and strategic direction.  
4. **AI-IRB Coordination**  
   4.1. If required, **Sponsor** or **PM** instructs the **AI-IRB Liaison** to arrange an official AI-IRB review.  
   4.2. **AI-IRB** may request clarifications, changes, or add conditions.  
   4.3. **PM** integrates these changes and re-submits the revised plan.  
5. **Formal Approval**  
   5.1. **Sponsor** renders a final decision: approve, approve with conditions, or reject.  
   5.2. If **Sponsor** approves, the project becomes authorized for planning within the AI-SDLC framework.  
   5.3. If conditions are attached, **PM** must incorporate them into the plan before final acceptance.  
   5.4. If rejected, the project is shelved or reworked, subject to potential future submission.  
6. **Post-Approval**  
   6.1. The **PM** works with the **Program Management Office** to integrate the newly approved AI project into the organizational project portfolio.  
   6.2. **Program Management Office (PMO)** ensures the project is tracked at the portfolio level, resources are allocated, and schedules are updated.  
   6.3. **Development** and **Quality Assurance** coordinate to begin the AI-SDLC phases, including design, prototyping, and full development, integrating **Exochain Peer Reviews** for model verification.  
7. **Documentation & Communication**  
   7.1. **PM** creates an official approval record, including the approval date, sponsor details, and any special conditions or IRB restrictions.  
   7.2. **PM** notifies all key stakeholders (Development, QA, Operations, and PMO) of the official project go-ahead.  
   7.3. **Legal and Compliance** retains records of relevant compliance or regulatory documents in the project file.  
8. **Periodic Review**  
   8.1. **PM** presents periodic status updates to **Sponsor** and **AI-IRB** (if required).  
   8.2. If any material changes occur, new “Change Requests” are logged and re-submitted for Sponsor and/or IRB approval as needed.  
   8.3. **AI-IRB Liaison** ensures continuing compliance and ethical standards.

**Short textual explanation:** This sequence diagram shows how an AI-related project moves from initial feasibility (Project Manager and Product Development) to consultation with the AI-IRB Liaison, legal checks, official sponsor approval, and potential AI-IRB Board review. Once all approvals are met, the project is integrated into the organizational portfolio by the PMO or else returned for rework or rejection.
