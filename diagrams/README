# Diagrams directory

The `diagrams` folder houses the visual counterparts to the AI-SDLC Standard Operating Procedures. Each diagram illustrates the flow of responsibilities, checkpoints, and approvals described in its paired SOP document.

## What you will find here
- **PlantUML sources (`.puml`)** – Editable text definitions for every diagram. Use these files to revise or generate new visuals while keeping changes under version control.
- **SVG exports (`.svg`)** – Scalable vector graphics suitable for documentation sites or slide decks.
- **PNG exports (`.PNG`)** – Raster versions for quick viewing and collaboration platforms that prefer bitmap images.

File names follow the SOP identifier pattern (`SOP-####-##-AI`) so you can quickly locate the matching Markdown procedure in [`../sops`](../sops/README). When updating a process, adjust the PlantUML source first and regenerate the derived SVG and PNG files to keep assets synchronized.

## Working with the diagrams
1. Open the relevant `.puml` file in your PlantUML editor of choice to review or modify the flow.
2. Render updated diagrams to both SVG and PNG formats to support different consumption needs.
3. Verify that the revised visuals continue to reflect the steps outlined in the associated SOP.
