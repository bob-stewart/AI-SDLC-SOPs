== Risk Register Initialization ==
DL -> DL: Create register from template
DL -> AM: Gather commercial/relationship risks
DL -> TL: Gather technology/integration risks
DL -> DL: Review SOW, client profile, historical patterns
DL -> DL: Score risks (L×I) and assign owners
DL -> IRB: Flag risks with ethical/compliance implications
IRB -> DL: Review and approve flagged risks
DL -> QA: Validate register completeness
QA -> DL: Confirm baseline ready

== Ongoing Risk Identification ==
RO -> DL: Submit new risk (any team member)
DL -> DL: Triage within 24 hours
alt High Priority (Score ≥15)
    DL -> AM: Immediate notification
    DL -> IRB: Immediate notification if AI-IRB flagged
else Medium/Low Priority
    DL -> DL: Add to weekly review agenda
end

== Weekly Risk Review ==
DL -> TL: Review open risks
DL -> RO: Request status updates
RO -> DL: Provide mitigation progress
alt Mitigation complete
    DL -> DL: Re-score risk
else Mitigation blocked
    DL -> AM: Escalate blocker
end

== Risk Escalation ==
DL -> AM: Escalate High priority risks
alt Client-dependent risk
    AM -> CS: Escalate to client sponsor
    CS -> AM: Provide resolution path
end
alt AI-IRB flagged risk
    DL -> IRB: Escalate for compliance review
    IRB -> IRB: Assess against AI-IRB thresholds
    alt Exceeds threshold
        IRB -> IRB: Escalate to AI-IRB Board
    end
end

== Gate Checkpoint Review ==
DL -> QA: Prepare gate checkpoint risk snapshot
QA -> IRB: Submit for gate review
IRB -> IRB: Review all flagged risks
alt Gate-blocking risk unresolved
    IRB -> DL: Gate passage blocked
    DL -> RO: Prioritize resolution
else All risks acceptable
    IRB -> DL: Gate passage approved
end

== Risk Closure ==
RO -> DL: Propose risk closure with rationale
DL -> DL: Validate closure criteria
alt Priority was High
    DL -> AM: Request closure approval
    DL -> IRB: Request closure approval
    AM -> DL: Approve
    IRB -> DL: Approve
end
