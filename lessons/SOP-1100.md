## Preamble
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the process for creating and maintaining documentation of job-related training for personnel participating in the AI-SDLC (Artificial Intelligence Systems Development Life Cycle), including mandatory AI-IRB compliance requirements as applicable. This procedure ensures that all training records are properly maintained and accessible for audit, regulatory, or operational needs. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1100-01-AI_Documentation-of-Training.md†L18-L18】
This SOP applies to all internal and external training programs that pertain to AI-SDLC activities, especially those subject to AI-IRB regulations. It also includes project-specific training, both client-facing and internally required, that is relevant to the design, development, testing, deployment, or maintenance of AI-driven or AI-related systems at the organization. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1100-01-AI_Documentation-of-Training.md†L24-L24】
