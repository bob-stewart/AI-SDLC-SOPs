# SOP-1300 — SOP-1300-01-AI\_AI-IRB-Governance-and-Oversight

## Preamble
The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define and document the governance structure and oversight responsibilities of the AI Institutional Review Board (AI-IRB) within the AI-SDLC framework. This SOP outlines the processes by which the AI-IRB evaluates, approves, and monitors AI projects to ensure compliance with ethical, regulatory, and organizational requirements. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1300-01-AI_AI-IRB-Governance-and-Oversight.md†L15-L15】
This SOP applies to all AI initiatives under the jurisdiction of the AI-IRB, including internal product development, external client engagements, research collaborations, and any other AI/ML-based or data-driven endeavors. It also governs the oversight and ethical review of AI models, tools, or algorithms developed or integrated into the production environment by the Performing Organization (Engineering), Contracting Organization (Product/Technical Support), or external partners. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1300-01-AI_AI-IRB-Governance-and-Oversight.md†L21-L21】
