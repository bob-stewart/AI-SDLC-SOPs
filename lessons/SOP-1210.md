# SOP-1210 — SOP-1210-01-AI\_Quality-Function

## Preamble
The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish and describe the **Quality Function** within the AI Systems Development Life Cycle (AI-SDLC). It details how quality oversight is conducted on product and project deliverables, ensuring alignment with regulatory requirements, user needs, and AI-IRB guidelines. This includes the creation of the **Quality Plan**, the development of test strategies and plans, validation activities, and acceptance criteria that guarantee high-quality AI-based products and services. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1210-01-AI_Quality-Function.md†L18-L18】
This SOP applies to all AI-SDLC projects that require Quality Assurance (QA) oversight, from initial concept through post-deployment review. It addresses: 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1210-01-AI_Quality-Function.md†L24-L24】
