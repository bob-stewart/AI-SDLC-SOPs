# SOP-1007 — SOP-1007-01-AI\_AI-Asset-Management

## Preamble
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the responsibilities and methods used for the identification, tracking, monitoring, and management of **AI assets**, including both **hardware** (servers, storage devices, GPUs, specialized AI accelerators) and **software** (AI frameworks, models, datasets, and related tools). Additionally, it addresses the **AI-IRB (Intelligences Review Board)** compliance checkpoints necessary to ensure ethically and legally sound asset usage. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1007-01-AI_AI-Asset-Management.md†L18-L18】
This SOP applies to all AI-related technical acquisitions, usage, and lifecycle management across all **SDLC** phases, from initial deployment of AI hardware and software, through modifications or updates, and finally to the secure decommissioning/disposal of assets. This includes on-premise and cloud-based AI resources governed by the **Performing Organization** (Engineering Department) and relevant support from the **AI-IRB**. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1007-01-AI_AI-Asset-Management.md†L22-L22】
