# SOP-1009 — SOP-1009-01-AI\_AI-Model-Drift-and-Re-Validation-Procedure

## Preamble
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the *Model Drift and Re-Validation* activities required within the AI System Development Life Cycle (AI-SDLC). It ensures that AI solutions remain compliant, reliable, and high-performing over time. This SOP covers: 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1009-01-AI_AI-Model-Drift-and-Re-Validation-Procedure.md†L17-L17】

## Activities / Assignments
1) **Data Scientist** implements continuous monitoring solutions (metrics/dashboards) for the AI model’s performance (accuracy, F1-score, etc.). 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1009-01-AI_AI-Model-Drift-and-Re-Validation-Procedure.md†L60-L60】
2) **Data Scientist** or **Ops** observes an anomaly or receives a triggered alert if metrics deviate from thresholds. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1009-01-AI_AI-Model-Drift-and-Re-Validation-Procedure.md†L61-L61】
