## Activities / Assignments
1) **Data Scientist** implements continuous monitoring solutions (metrics/dashboards) for the AI model’s performance (accuracy, F1-score, etc.). 【F:sops/SOP-1009-01-AI_AI-Model-Drift-and-Re-Validation-Procedure.md†L60-L60】
2) **Data Scientist** or **Ops** observes an anomaly or receives a triggered alert if metrics deviate from thresholds. 【F:sops/SOP-1009-01-AI_AI-Model-Drift-and-Re-Validation-Procedure.md†L61-L61】
