# SOP-1011 — SOP-1011-01-AI\_AI-Feature-Decommissioning-and-Model-Retirement

## Preamble
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define and formalize the process for **decommissioning AI features** and **retiring AI models** used in the production environment, ensuring minimal disruption to users, compliance with ethical/AI-IRB guidelines, and proper knowledge transfer for potential future reference. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1011-01-AI_AI-Feature-Decommissioning-and-Model-Retirement.md†L17-L17】
This SOP applies to all **SDLC AI-based features** and **machine learning models** that are fully or partially deployed in production and must be **disabled**, **removed**, or **deprecated** from the live environment. It covers: 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1011-01-AI_AI-Feature-Decommissioning-and-Model-Retirement.md†L23-L23】

## Activities / Assignments
1) **Trigger Identification** — A recognized need to retire an AI feature or model arises. Possible triggers: — Outdated model performance — Ethical or compliance reasons (AI-IRB) — Contract or license expiration — Business direction changes — Product Management logs a Decommission Request, capturing rationale, scope, date, and impacted user groups. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1011-01-AI_AI-Feature-Decommissioning-and-Model-Retirement.md†L101-L107】
2) **Initial IRB Check** — AI-IRB Liaison quickly reviews the request for potential regulatory or ethical concerns. — If concerns exist, the IRB Liaison organizes a special ethics review prior to finalizing. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1011-01-AI_AI-Feature-Decommissioning-and-Model-Retirement.md†L108-L110】
