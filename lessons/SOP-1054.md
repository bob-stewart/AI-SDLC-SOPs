## Preamble
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a structured methodology for obtaining approvals, sponsorship, and oversight of AI-related projects within the organization. It defines the steps, responsibilities, and deliverables required to ensure thorough evaluation by relevant stakeholders—most notably the AI-IRB (AI Institutional Review Board)—and alignment with strategic, legal, and ethical standards. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1054-01-AI_AI-Regulated-Project-Approvals-and-Sponsorship.md†L8-L8】
This SOP applies to all AI-related projects requiring corporate approval, budget allocation, or strategic sponsorship. It encompasses new projects, major enhancements, incremental updates, and pilot programs where AI-based solutions are developed or deployed. All employees, contractors, or partners engaged in these AI projects must adhere to this SOP before requesting official project approval or sponsorship. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1054-01-AI_AI-Regulated-Project-Approvals-and-Sponsorship.md†L12-L12】
