# SOP-1101 — SOP-1101-01-AI\_Training-and-Documentation

## Preamble
This SOP describes the method for identifying, analyzing, and preparing training and documentation materials necessary for effective deployment of AI-related enhancements or products to both internal functional units and external end-users under the AI-SDLC. Additionally, it outlines roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth knowledge transfer for AI-based or standard systems. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1101-01-AI_Training-and-Documentation.md†L14-L14】

## Learning Objectives
- This SOP describes the method for identifying, analyzing, and preparing training and documentation materials necessary for effective deployment of AI-related enhancements or products to both internal functional units and external end-users under the AI-SDLC. Additionally, it outlines roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth knowledge transfer for AI-based or standard systems. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1101-01-AI_Training-and-Documentation.md†L14-L14】

## Activities / Assignments
1) Technical Support & Product Group review the Scope of Work (SOW) from the Requirements Phase. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1101-01-AI_Training-and-Documentation.md†L56-L56】
2) These groups create or update a Training Needs Document (TND) that — Lists functionality requiring training (including any specialized AI functionality). — Identifies trainers (internal or external). — Defines audiences (internal Dev, QA, Ops, external clients, etc.). — Notes whether FOA or pilot sessions are required. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1101-01-AI_Training-and-Documentation.md†L57-L61】
