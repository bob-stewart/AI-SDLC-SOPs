## Activities / Assignments
1) Technical Support & Product Group review the Scope of Work (SOW) from the Requirements Phase. 【F:sops/SOP-1101-01-AI_Training-and-Documentation.md†L56-L56】
2) These groups create or update a Training Needs Document (TND) that — Lists functionality requiring training (including any specialized AI functionality). — Identifies trainers (internal or external). — Defines audiences (internal Dev, QA, Ops, external clients, etc.). — Notes whether FOA or pilot sessions are required. 【F:sops/SOP-1101-01-AI_Training-and-Documentation.md†L57-L61】
