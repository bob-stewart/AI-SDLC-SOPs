# SOP-2002 — SOP-2002-01-AI\_Control-of-Quality-Records

## Preamble
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the process for managing and controlling quality records throughout their lifecycle in the AI-SDLC (Artificial Intelligence System Development Life Cycle) environment. The goal is to ensure that all records—whether physical or electronic—are identifiable, retrievable, protected from damage or loss, and retained or disposed of in compliance with regulatory, contractual, and internal AI-IRB (AI Institutional Review Board) requirements. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-2002-01-AI_Control-of-Quality-Records.md†L19-L19】
This SOP applies to all AI-SDLC projects and associated quality records generated, received, maintained, archived, or disposed of by the Performing Organization (e.g., Engineering Department) and the Contracting Organization (e.g., Product and Technical Support). This includes records relating to: 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-2002-01-AI_Control-of-Quality-Records.md†L23-L23】

## Activities / Assignments
1) Identify Required Records — During project planning and as part of each Gate Review, determine which deliverables qualify as quality records (e.g., design documents, test logs, AI compliance approvals). 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-2002-01-AI_Control-of-Quality-Records.md†L80-L81】
2) Use Approved Templates — If templates exist for design, test, or compliance records, the team must use them to ensure consistency. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-2002-01-AI_Control-of-Quality-Records.md†L82-L83】
