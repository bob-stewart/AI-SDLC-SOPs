# SOP-1013 — SOP-1013-01-AI\_AI-Model-Post-Production-Monitoring-and-Ongoing-Validation

## Preamble
The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define a rigorous, consistent method for post-production monitoring and ongoing validation of AI/ML models within the organization’s environment. This procedure ensures that all deployed AI models continue to perform within acceptable parameters, remain compliant with relevant regulations, and address any potential performance or ethical concerns over time. 【F:sops/SOP-1013-01-AI_AI-Model-Post-Production-Monitoring-and-Ongoing-Validation.md†L18-L18】
This SOP applies to all AI/ML models deployed in production by the organization, including (but not limited to) supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models. It covers every phase post-deployment, including performance monitoring, drift detection, revalidation, stakeholder notification, and documentation of all updates or model changes. This SOP references and extends any requirements set by the AI-IRB, relevant regulatory guidelines, and corporate best practices. 【F:sops/SOP-1013-01-AI_AI-Model-Post-Production-Monitoring-and-Ongoing-Validation.md†L24-L24】
