# SOP-1008 — SOP-1008-01-AI\_AI-Incident-and-Escalation-Management

## Preamble
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the steps and responsibilities for identifying, reporting, tracking, and escalating AI-related incidents in the **AI-SDLC** environment. An *AI-related incident* is any anomaly or unexpected event caused or impacted by an AI component that could result in system disruption, data compromise, adverse user impact, or risk to compliance/regulatory standards. The **AI-IRB** (Artificial Intelligence Institutional Review Board) is a key stakeholder in determining compliance or advanced risk escalations. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1008-01-AI_AI-Incident-and-Escalation-Management.md†L19-L19】
This SOP covers the lifecycle of AI incident handling and escalation, including detection, triage, resolution, and the required follow-up in the **AI-SDLC** environment. It applies to all AI-related services, platforms, or processes within the organization. This includes: 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1008-01-AI_AI-Incident-and-Escalation-Management.md†L25-L25】

## Activities / Assignments
1) **Identify AI Incident** — Triggered by system alerts, error logs, user complaints, or abnormal model outputs. — `Technical Support (TS)` and `Operations` typically act as the first line to identify or confirm anomalies. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1008-01-AI_AI-Incident-and-Escalation-Management.md†L81-L83】
2) **Open Incident Ticket** — The Incident Reporter logs the issue in the central Incident Management tool with relevant details: — Date/time of detection — Description of anomaly — Impact, if known — AI module or environment involved (e.g., dev, staging, production) 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1008-01-AI_AI-Incident-and-Escalation-Management.md†L84-L89】
