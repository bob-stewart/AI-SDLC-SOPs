# SOP-1005 — SOP-1005-01-AI\_AI-Integrated-Release-Planning

## Preamble
The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define and document **AI-integrated release planning** activities in the **AI-SDLC** (Artificial Intelligence Systems Development Life Cycle). This procedure ensures that new or updated AI-based features or products are evaluated, prioritized, and scheduled in alignment with **business goals**, **AI-IRB** requirements, and **organizational** priorities. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1005-01-AI_AI-Integrated-Release-Planning.md†L17-L17】
This SOP covers **end-to-end release planning** for AI-based software solutions, from preliminary concept or feature requests through the finalization of high-level commitments in **Gate 10**. It coordinates input from **Product Development**, **AI-IRB Liaison**, **Technical Support**, and **Engineering**, aiming to achieve a feasible and compliant release scope. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1005-01-AI_AI-Integrated-Release-Planning.md†L21-L21】
