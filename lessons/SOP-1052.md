# SOP-1052 — SOP-1052-01-AI\_AI-Model-Lifecycle-Oversight-and-Governance

## Preamble
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the processes for overseeing AI model lifecycle events under the AI-SDLC. It establishes methods for ensuring compliance with AI regulatory board requirements, continuous performance monitoring, data governance, and structured communication among key stakeholders. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1052-01-AI_AI-Model-Lifecycle-Oversight-and-Governance.md†L15-L15】
This SOP applies to all AI models developed, tested, and deployed under the AI-SDLC within the organization. It specifically addresses procedures from model inception to decommissioning, ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance throughout the model’s life. 【https://github.com/aisdlc/AI-SDLC-SOPs/blob/main/sops/SOP-1052-01-AI_AI-Model-Lifecycle-Oversight-and-Governance.md†L21-L21】
