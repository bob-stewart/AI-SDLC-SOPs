# AI-SDLC-SOPs

This repository contains the **official Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for the **AI-SDLC Institute**, governing **AI model compliance, risk assessment, and governance workflows**.

This integrated AI-SDLC set of SOPs ensures a rigorous end-to-end framework guided by the AI-IRB to manage risk, compliance, ethics, and operational excellence. Each SOP addresses a particular aspect of AI solution design, development, governance, and retirement. By adhering to these procedures, organizations can mitigate ethical, compliance, and technical risks while consistently delivering robust, fair, and transparent AI systems.
