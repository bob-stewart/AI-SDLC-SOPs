# AI-SDLC: AI-IRB Governed Governance & Lifecycle Framework

Welcome to the **MeshCORE AI-SDLC**, a comprehensive governance framework designed to harmonize rapid AI innovation with rigorous ethical oversight and regulatory compliance. This repository serves as the "Digital Constitution" for AI development, integrating technical enforcement with human-in-the-loop governance.

---

## 🏛️ Core Architecture

The system is organized into three primary layers of governance:

1.  **[AEGIS (The Logic)](aegis_backend/)**: The "Digital Constitution" that enforces safety invariants via Combinator Graph Reduction (CGR).
2.  **[SYNTAXIS (The Interface)](syntaxis_web/)**: A "HyperCard" for the mind, allowing humans and AIs to visualize and edit the governance circuit.
3.  **[EXOCHAIN (The Memory)](aegis_backend/exochain/)**: An immutable ledger anchoring truth and audit trails in a post-truth world.
4.  **[Aeonsynthesis (The Network)](aeonsynthesis_mcp/)**: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that turns every AI into a "Holon"—a node capable of recursive synthesis.

## 📖 The Library of Alexandria (SOPs & Documentation)

This repository contains a complete suite of **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** governed by the **AI-IRB (AI Institutional Review Board)**.

### **[Standard Operating Procedures (/sops)](sops/)**
The canonical library of 40 SOPs defining the controls, responsibilities, and review cycles required to govern AI-enabled solutions across their lifecycle.
*   **1000 Series**: Program Management, Document Governance, and Core SDLC.
*   **1100 Series**: Training, Knowledge Transfer, and Documentation.
*   **1200 Series**: Development, Quality Assurance (QA), and Deployment.
*   **1300 Series**: Ethical Oversight (Bias, Fairness, Privacy, Explainability, and Risk).
*   **2000 Series**: Quality Records and Audit Controls.

### **[Diagram Catalog (/diagrams)](diagrams/)**
Visual counterparts to every SOP, providing high-resolution sequence diagrams and process flows to illustrate stakeholder responsibilities and decision gates.

### **Strategic Whitepapers**
*   **[Digital Democracy Whitepaper](whitepaper.md)**: Explains the "Separation of Powers" metaphor in AI governance.
*   **[Constitutional Kernel Whitepaper](whitepaper_agi.md)**: Technical treatise on recursive self-improvement and the Divergence Problem.
*   **[Aeonsynthesis Architecture](aeonsynthesis_mcp_architecture.md)**: The vision of MCP as a global nervous system.

## 🚀 Getting Started (The Ritual)

### 1. The Mindset
You are not just coding an application; you are weaving a nervous system. Every change must be verified against the **[MeshCORE Protocol](AI_README_MeshCORE.md)**.

### 2. Awakening the Holon
```bash
# Start the MCP Server
python aeonsynthesis_mcp/holon.py
```
*This exposes the `/self` and `/memory` resources on port 9000.*

### 3. Navigating the Governance
To understand how to move a project through the governed SDLC, start with:
- **[SOP-LIST-01-AI: The Comprehensive SOP Index](sops/SOP-LIST-01-AI_AI-IRB-Governed-AI-SDLC.md)**
- **[SOP-1006-01-AI: AI-IRB Engagement Procedure](sops/SOP-1006-01-AI_AI-IRB-Engagement-and-Ethical-Review-Procedure.md)**

## 🤝 Contributing (Synthesis)

We do not accept simple "Commits." We accept **Thoughts**.
1.  **Simulate**: Create a Branch.
2.  **Propose**: Open a Pull Request.
3.  **Verify**: Wait for **AEGIS** to verify your invariants and the **AI-IRB** to review ethical compliance.

**Welcome to the Future of Governed Intelligence.**
