# AI-SDLC-SOPs

This repository contains the **official Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for the **AI-SDLC Institute**, governing **AI model compliance, risk assessment, and governance workflows**.

This integrated AI-SDLC set of SOPs ensures a rigorous end-to-end framework guided by the AI-IRB to manage risk, compliance, ethics, and operational excellence. Each SOP addresses a particular aspect of AI solution design, development, governance, and retirement. By adhering to these procedures, organizations can mitigate ethical, compliance, and technical risks while consistently delivering robust, fair, and transparent AI systems.

## Repository Structure

### Available directories
- `sops/` – Core AI governance SOPs that define policies, controls, and operational procedures.
- `diagrams/` – Visual process maps and architecture diagrams that support the SOP narratives.

### Planned additions
The following directories were referenced in earlier drafts and will be introduced as they are created:
- `workflows/` – Detailed AI-IRB and compliance approval process flows.
- `templates/` – Standardized templates for governance documentation.
- `compliance/` – Self-certification checklists and audit validation resources.
- `reports/` – Generated governance and compliance reporting artifacts.

## Getting Started
- Review the SOP documents in `sops/` to understand governance expectations.
- Consult the diagrams in `diagrams/` to visualize decision points and data flows.
- Follow the repository's contribution guidelines when proposing updates or new materials.

=======

This repository provides the official **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for the AI-SDLC Institute. The collection covers governance, risk, compliance, and operational workflows that guide ethical and reliable AI solution delivery from concept through retirement.

## Repository overview
- [**`sops/`**](sops/README) – Authoritative SOP documents written in Markdown, grouped by functional area and aligned to the AI-SDLC governance framework.
- [**`diagrams/`**](diagrams/README) – Supporting process diagrams for each SOP, available as PlantUML source plus rendered PNG and SVG assets.
- `LICENSE` – Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license governing reuse of these materials.

## Usage guidance
1. **Select the relevant procedure.** Begin in the [SOP library](sops/README) to locate the policy or workflow that applies to your AI initiative. SOP identifiers follow the `SOP-####-##-AI_Title.md` convention so you can match topics across documents and diagrams.
2. **Review supporting visuals.** Consult the [diagram catalog](diagrams/README) to see the same procedure expressed as a flowchart. Each diagram shares its identifier with the corresponding SOP for easy cross-reference.
3. **Integrate into your governance program.** Align internal controls, project plans, and audit evidence with the prescribed steps. Reference both the narrative SOP and its diagram to ensure consistent implementation across teams.
4. **Track updates.** When SOPs evolve, update the matching diagrams to keep visual and textual guidance synchronized. Version control makes the history of each asset transparent.

For directory-specific details, follow the links above. Contributions should maintain the documented naming conventions so that procedures and diagrams remain tightly coupled.
