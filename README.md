# AI-SDLC-SOPs

This repository provides the official **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for the AI-SDLC Institute. The collection covers governance, risk, compliance, and operational workflows that guide ethical and reliable AI solution delivery from concept through retirement.

## Repository overview
- [**`sops/`**](sops/README) – Authoritative SOP documents written in Markdown, grouped by functional area and aligned to the AI-SDLC governance framework.
- [**`diagrams/`**](diagrams/README) – Supporting process diagrams for each SOP, available as PlantUML source plus rendered PNG and SVG assets.
- `LICENSE` – Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license governing reuse of these materials.

## Usage guidance
1. **Select the relevant procedure.** Begin in the [SOP library](sops/README) to locate the policy or workflow that applies to your AI initiative. SOP identifiers follow the `SOP-####-##-AI_Title.md` convention so you can match topics across documents and diagrams.
2. **Review supporting visuals.** Consult the [diagram catalog](diagrams/README) to see the same procedure expressed as a flowchart. Each diagram shares its identifier with the corresponding SOP for easy cross-reference.
3. **Integrate into your governance program.** Align internal controls, project plans, and audit evidence with the prescribed steps. Reference both the narrative SOP and its diagram to ensure consistent implementation across teams.
4. **Track updates.** When SOPs evolve, update the matching diagrams to keep visual and textual guidance synchronized. Version control makes the history of each asset transparent.

For directory-specific details, follow the links above. Contributions should maintain the documented naming conventions so that procedures and diagrams remain tightly coupled.
