# Lesson Plan Draft: AI Model Post-Production Monitoring and Ongoing Validation

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1013-01-AI_AI-Model-Post-Production-Monitoring-and-Ongoing-Validation

## Objective

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define a rigorous, consistent method for post-production monitoring and ongoing validation of AI/ML models within the organization’s environment. This procedure ensures that all deployed AI models continue to perform within acceptable parameters, remain compliant with relevant regulations, and address any potential performance or ethical concerns over time.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to all AI/ML models deployed in production by the organization, including (but not limited to) supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models. It covers every phase post-deployment, including performance monitoring, drift detection, revalidation, stakeholder notification, and documentation of all updates or model changes. This SOP references and extends any requirements set by the AI-IRB, relevant regulatory guidelines, and corporate best practices.

## Key Definitions

- **AI-IRB**: The AI Institutional Review Board responsible for ethical, regulatory, and compliance oversight.
- **Model Drift**: A significant change in data patterns (feature distribution) or changes in model performance over time.
- **Performance Threshold**: Predefined standard(s) for acceptable model outputs (accuracy, recall, etc.) outlined in project scope.
- **Retraining**: The process of updating or re-fitting an AI model using new data or refined parameters.
- **Monitoring Horizon**: The interval or schedule at which the model’s performance is systematically evaluated.
- **Alert Trigger**: An automated mechanism that flags unusual or substandard performance requiring further investigation.

## Key Roles

- **AI Dev Team**: Implements monitoring hooks, addresses performance/drift issues, coordinates with Data Science Lead for model retraining, and updates code repositories.
- **Data Science Lead**: Oversees performance metrics, designs drift detection protocols, ensures revalidation is consistent with the originally stated business and regulatory objectives.
- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Confirms that any modifications to the model remain compliant with ethical and regulatory guidelines. Reviews any new data usage or expanded scope for compliance.
- **MLOps Engineer**: Creates, configures, and maintains production monitoring pipelines; ensures version control for all changes and synchronization across environments.
- **Quality Assurance**: Audits performance logs, ensures compliance with acceptance criteria, and organizes periodic reviews in coordination with AI-IRB Liaison.
- **Technical Support**: Acts as frontline contact for user issues or feedback about model outputs. Notifies AI Dev Team of any anomalies or user-facing performance concerns.
- **Operations Manager**: Manages system-level performance and availability, ensures that infrastructure scaling or changes do not compromise model monitoring or logging systems.
- **Legal/Compliance**: Advises on any new constraints arising from data privacy laws, intellectual property rights, or other regulatory frameworks if additional data or new model usage is introduced.
