# Lesson Plan Draft: AI Model Drift and Re-Validation Procedure

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1009-01-AI_AI-Model-Drift-and-Re-Validation-Procedure

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the *Model Drift and Re-Validation* activities required within the AI System Development Life Cycle (AI-SDLC). It ensures that AI solutions remain compliant, reliable, and high-performing over time. This SOP covers:

* **Detection** of model/data drift triggers (technical, performance, data changes, domain shifts).  
* **Impact analysis** on business logic, regulatory constraints, and user experience.  
* **Periodic re-validation** to confirm the model’s ongoing suitability, fairness, and compliance.  
* **Collaboration** with the AI-IRB (AI Institutional Review Board) for ethical, regulatory, and risk oversight.

This SOP applies to all AI models (ML, NLP, neural networks, LLMs, etc.) used in production systems governed by \[Your Organization\]. All staff and vendors who implement or maintain these AI systems must comply with this procedure.

## Audience & Applicability

Covers This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the Model Drift and Re-Validation activities required within the AI System Development Life Cycle (AI-SDLC). It ensures that AI solutions remain compliant, reliable, and high-performing over time. This SOP covers. Applies to all AI models (ML, NLP, neural networks, LLMs, etc.) used in production systems governed by [Your Organization]. All staff and vendors who implement or maintain these AI systems must comply with this procedure.

## Key Definitions

- **Model Drift**: A change in model behavior or performance when the underlying data or environment differs significantly from training
- **AI-IRB**: AI Institutional Review Board providing compliance, ethical, and regulatory oversight for AI projects
- **Re-Validation**: Formal process of testing and re-assessing an AI model to ensure ongoing compliance, accuracy, reliability, etc.
- **Trigger Event**: A measured threshold breach (performance drop) or business/regulatory change that initiates drift analysis
- **Business Owner**: The stakeholder or sponsor who “owns” the AI solution’s business function
- **Data Shift**: Statistical changes in input features, distribution, or user behaviors that cause mismatch from training data
- **Bias Check**: Process for verifying that the model output or performance has not skewed in ways impacting protected groups

## Key Roles

- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Coordinates with the AI-IRB for oversight on model drift risk. Reviews ethical/regulatory concerns related to re-validation.
- **Business Owner**: Owns the AI solution’s operational objectives. Approves re-validation budget and timelines.
- **Data Scientist/Engineer**: Monitors model performance metrics, triggers drift analysis, performs re-validation tasks, and documents results.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Oversees the correctness and compliance of the re-validation steps, ensuring alignment with QA standards.
- **Operations (Ops)**: Implements changes and updates in the production environment. Communicates production status and logs to the Data Scientist.
- **Project Manager**: Manages scheduling, resource allocation, and communication between teams for re-validation tasks.
- **Security/Compliance**: Assesses potential security, privacy, or other compliance implications during re-validation.
