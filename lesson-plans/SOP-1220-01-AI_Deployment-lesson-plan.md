# Lesson Plan Draft: Deployment (AI-SDLC)

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1220-01-AI_Deployment

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the **planning and implementation requirements** for deploying AI-driven systems and enhancements into production as part of the **AI-SDLC** (Artificial Intelligence System Development Life Cycle). It ensures that releases meet **compliance** (including AI-IRB concerns), are fully tested, documented, and successfully transitioned to production/operations environments.

## Audience & Applicability

Encompasses all deployment stages of an AI-based or AI-affecting system.
