# Lesson Plan Draft: Capacity Management (AI-Integrated)

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1002-01-AI_Capacity-Management

## Objective

This **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** establishes the **Capacity Management** guidelines for AI-driven systems within the **AI-SDLC** (Systems Development Life Cycle) environment, ensuring **system resources** (compute, storage, memory, network) meet operational requirements for all **phases** (Development, Testing, Deployment, and Production). This SOP integrates specialized considerations for **AI-IRB** (AI Intelligences Review Board) oversight when capacity expansions or new AI components might impose ethical or compliance concerns.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to All AI-SDLC projects that involve forecasting, planning, and managing capacity for AI solutions, from early requirements definition through post-deployment operational support. Includes focus areas such as Applies To, Out of Scope, and Exceptions.

## Key Definitions

- **AI-IRB**: AI Intelligences Review Board; ensures expansions or changes in AI capacity comply with ethical and safety reviews.
- **Capacity Management**: The process of ensuring adequate system resources (compute, GPU, memory, storage, network) for AI solution demands.
- **AI-SDLC**: Systems Development Life Cycle tailored for AI solutions, including AI-IRB gates and approvals.
- **Trigger Event**: Any event requiring re-assessment of capacity (e.g., new dataset, user surge, new AI model version).
- **Forecast**: The predicted usage, resource consumption, and performance requirements over time.

## Key Roles

- **Capacity Manager**: Oversees capacity planning, ensures resource availability, monitors performance trends, coordinates escalations.
- **Project Manager**: Initiates capacity review in project planning, collects resource estimates from teams, and integrates them into overall project schedule/budget.
- **AI Development Lead**: Provides AI workload details, usage patterns, new model release info. Collaborates with Capacity Manager on resource sizing.
- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Determines if capacity changes for AI solutions might trigger an AI-IRB review for safety, ethics, or compliance concerns.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Verifies capacity readiness in testing phases, ensures performance metrics are met under load, logs capacity issues in defect tracking.
- **Operations Team**: Implements capacity changes, monitors production usage, responds to threshold alerts, escalates to Capacity Manager.
- **Product Owner / Sponsor**: Confirms business requirements, signs off on capacity expansions if cost/time exceed planned scope.
