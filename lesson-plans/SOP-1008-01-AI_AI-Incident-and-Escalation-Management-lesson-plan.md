# Lesson Plan Draft: AI Incident and Escalation Management

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1008-01-AI_AI-Incident-and-Escalation-Management

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the steps and responsibilities for identifying, reporting, tracking, and escalating AI-related incidents in the **AI-SDLC** environment. An *AI-related incident* is any anomaly or unexpected event caused or impacted by an AI component that could result in system disruption, data compromise, adverse user impact, or risk to compliance/regulatory standards. The **AI-IRB** (Artificial Intelligence Institutional Review Board) is a key stakeholder in determining compliance or advanced risk escalations.

## Audience & Applicability

Covers the lifecycle of AI incident handling and escalation, including detection, triage, resolution, and the required follow-up in the AI-SDLC environment. It applies to all AI-related services, platforms, or processes within the organization. This includes.

## Key Definitions

- **AI-IRB**: Artificial Intelligence Institutional Review Board. Evaluates and approves AI usage from compliance and ethics standpoints.
- **Incident**: Any unplanned or unexpected event that disrupts or has the potential to disrupt AI-based operations or that triggers ethical or compliance concerns.
- **Escalation**: The formal process of raising an incident to a higher authority or specialized team (e.g. AI-IRB) for guidance, approval, or advanced troubleshooting.
- **Triage**: Rapid initial assessment of an incident’s nature, severity, and impact to prioritize resources and next steps.
- **SDLC**: System Development Life Cycle. In this context, it’s the specialized AI-SDLC framework.
- **Ops**: Operations team. Responsible for system environment stability, including servers and deployments.
- **TS**: Technical Support. The first line of contact for external or internal user queries or issues.

## Key Roles

- **Incident Reporter**: Submits the initial incident report upon noticing an AI anomaly or potential risk.
- **Incident Manager**: Owns the incident from triage to closure, determines severity, and coordinates with other roles.
- **Development**: Provides code/model fixes if required, including root-cause analysis for AI modules.
- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Reviews incidents for compliance or ethical impact, escalates to AI-IRB if necessary.
- **Operations**: Applies environment or configuration changes, monitors AI deployment health, and helps apply hotfixes.
- **Quality Assurance**: Confirms the resolution effectiveness through testing, ensures no regression or additional side effects.
- **Technical Support**: Receives external or user-reported incidents, logs them, and routes them to the Incident Manager.
- **Security/Compliance**: Investigates incidents that indicate a data breach, regulatory violation, or major security flaw.
