# Lesson Plan Draft: . Objective

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1060-01-AI_Service-Level-Agreement

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a structured method for defining, designing, and implementing a **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** in the context of the **AI-SDLC** (AI Systems Development Life Cycle). The SLA ensures that service expectations—such as performance, availability, ethics compliance, and support—are explicitly defined and managed for AI-related projects/systems.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to all AI-driven solutions managed under the AI-SDLC process.
