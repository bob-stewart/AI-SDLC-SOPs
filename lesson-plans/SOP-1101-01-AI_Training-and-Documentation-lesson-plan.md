# Lesson Plan Draft: Training and Documentation

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1101-01-AI_Training-and-Documentation

## Objective

This SOP describes the method for identifying, analyzing, and preparing training and documentation materials necessary for effective deployment of AI-related enhancements or products to both internal functional units and external end-users under the AI-SDLC. Additionally, it outlines roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth knowledge transfer for AI-based or standard systems.

Scope:

* Covers all training (internal or external) required by the AI-SDLC, including product documentation, user manuals, and release notes.  
* Encompasses the steps from requirements definition of training materials to the execution of training (including FOA, pilot sessions, and final user classes).  
* Applies to internal staff (e.g., developers, testers, operations) and external clients or partners who receive training on AI products or features.  
* Excludes new-hire onboarding training (handled by HR) except where AI compliance is mandatory.  
* Incorporates possible AI-IRB or ethics regulatory oversight for AI-based solutions.
