# Lesson Plan Draft: AI Knowledge Transfer and Handover Procedure

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1015-01-AI_AI-Knowledge-Transfer-and-Handover-Procedure

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a detailed method for **knowledge transfer** (KT) and **handover** activities within an **AI project lifecycle**. It ensures continuity, comprehension, and responsible stewardship when AI systems transition between teams (e.g., from Development to Operations, or from an external vendor to an internal group). This SOP addresses roles, steps, required documentation, and best practices for knowledge dissemination, specifically tailored to the complexities of AI models, data, and ongoing compliance with AI-IRB guidelines.

## Audience & Applicability

Covers 1. Applicability. 2. Exclusions.

## Key Definitions

- **AI-IRB**: Internal Review Board for AI, ensuring responsible AI governance, compliance, and ethics.
- **Handover**: The process of transferring ownership of AI code, data, and knowledge from one entity to another.
- **KT (Knowledge Transfer)**: Structured approach to share domain, technical, and operational knowledge about an AI solution.
- **Receiving Org**: The group taking responsibility for the AI solution post-handover.
- **Handover Package**: Collection of documents, model artifacts, code, test logs, compliance checklists, etc. used for knowledge transfer.

## Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Oversees the knowledge transfer timeline, ensures tasks are planned and completed, coordinates cross-functional sign-offs.
- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Verifies continuing compliance with AI-IRB stipulations, ensures all relevant guidelines are included in the handover.
- **AI Development Team**: Prepares code repositories, model documentation, addresses open technical questions.
- **Data Scientist**: Provides dataset specifics, feature engineering details, data documentation, and provenance.
- **MLOps/Operations**: Understands production environment, operational metrics, pipeline orchestrations; ensures environment readiness.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Checks completeness and correctness of handover package, validates final compliance logs, organizes final sign-offs.
- **Receiving Organization**: Participates in knowledge transfer sessions, reviews documentation, provides acceptance sign-off.
