# Lesson Plan Draft: AI Asset Management

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1007-01-AI_AI-Asset-Management

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the responsibilities and methods used for the identification, tracking, monitoring, and management of **AI assets**, including both **hardware** (servers, storage devices, GPUs, specialized AI accelerators) and **software** (AI frameworks, models, datasets, and related tools). Additionally, it addresses the **AI-IRB (Intelligences Review Board)** compliance checkpoints necessary to ensure ethically and legally sound asset usage.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to all AI-related technical acquisitions, usage, and lifecycle management across all SDLC phases, from initial deployment of AI hardware and software, through modifications or updates, and finally to the secure decommissioning/disposal of assets. This includes on-premise and cloud-based AI resources governed by the Performing Organization (Engineering Department) and relevant support from the AI-IRB.

## Key Definitions

- No key definitions provided.

## Key Roles

- **Asset Owner**: • Coordinates daily usage of assigned AI asset • Reports any changes, reconfigurations, or problems to the Asset Manager • Ensures AI usage is within ethical and compliance guidelines set forth by the AI-IRB.
- **Asset Manager**: • Maintains the AI Asset Tracking Database • Receives notifications about asset changes or new acquisitions • Updates asset records, including compliance tags if relevant • Checks with the AI-IRB Liaison if asset usage might pose compliance risks.
- **AI-IRB Liaison**: • Reviews any new asset requests that might have ethical or compliance implications • Coordinates with external regulators or legal teams if needed • Approves or denies usage modifications based on ethical, privacy, or regulatory concerns.
- **Operations**: • Provides final approval for deployment environment changes • Moves AI assets from staging to production or from on-premise to cloud environment • Implements security measures for AI asset storage or disposal.
- **Engineering**: • Communicates new AI asset needs to the Asset Manager • Sets up environment for model training/inference • Performs and documents reconfiguration steps per the AI-IRB compliance guidelines.
- **Technical Support**: • Addresses first-level issues with AI asset usage or environment • Routes advanced requests to Engineering or Asset Manager • Informs the AI-IRB Liaison if user queries hint at potential compliance or ethical concerns.
- **Quality Assurance**: • Verifies correct usage of AI assets is documented and tested • Confirms that necessary steps for reconfiguration or disposal were followed • Issues corrective or preventive actions if asset usage fails any compliance or internal QA checks.
