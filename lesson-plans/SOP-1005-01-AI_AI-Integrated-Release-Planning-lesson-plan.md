# Lesson Plan Draft: AI-Integrated Release Planning

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1005-01-AI_AI-Integrated-Release-Planning

## Objective

The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define and document **AI-integrated release planning** activities in the **AI-SDLC** (Artificial Intelligence Systems Development Life Cycle). This procedure ensures that new or updated AI-based features or products are evaluated, prioritized, and scheduled in alignment with **business goals**, **AI-IRB** requirements, and **organizational** priorities.

## Audience & Applicability

Covers end-to-end release planning for AI-based software solutions, from preliminary concept or feature requests through the finalization of high-level commitments in Gate 10. It coordinates input from Product Development, AI-IRB Liaison, Technical Support, and Engineering, aiming to achieve a feasible and compliant release scope.

## Key Definitions

- **AI-IRB**: An internal (or external) AI Institutional Review Board responsible for ensuring that any AI features meet ethical and regulatory guidelines.
- **SOW**: Scope of Workâ€”document listing features, deliverables, costs, and resources for a given release or AI project.
- **Release**: A set of AI-based features, enhancements, or bug fixes that are planned, developed, and deployed together as part of the AI-SDLC.
- **Gates**: Predefined decision points in the AI-SDLC: from ideation (Gate 12) to general availability (Gate 0).
- **Feasibility**: Assessment of resources (budget, staff), AI model readiness, ethical constraints, time, and complexity for each requested feature.

## Key Roles

- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Reviews planned AI features for ethical/regulatory compliance. Advises on acceptance or required modifications.
- **Product Development**: Gathers feature requests (internal or external), defines priority and user-value alignment.
- **Technical Support**: Inputs known production issues or user feedback for potential release.
- **Engineering Department**: Provides feasibility (time, cost, AI model readiness) estimates, scope clarifications, technical guidance.
- **PMO**: Consolidates release schedules, ensures cross-project alignment, and reports to senior management.
- **Project Manager**: Facilitates release planning sessions, integrates inputs from all stakeholders, finalizes SOW documentation.
- **Project Sponsor**: Arbitrates scope, cost, schedule conflicts. Endorses final release scope for Gate approval.
- **Senior Management**: Sets overall business strategy, high-level R&D budgets, and final approval at key gates as needed.
