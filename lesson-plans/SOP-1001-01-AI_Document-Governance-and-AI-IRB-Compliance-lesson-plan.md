# Lesson Plan Draft: Document Governance and AI-IRB Compliance

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1001-01-AI_Document-Governance-and-AI-IRB-Compliance

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines and governs the creation, review, approval, control, storage, and archival of **all** documentation required in the **AI-SDLC** (Artificial Intelligence Systems Development Life Cycle). Given the heightened oversight for AI solutions, this SOP also incorporates **AI-IRB** (AI Institutional Review Board) compliance checks and approvals for any sensitive or high-risk AI systems.

Key goals:

* Ensure standardized document governance across all AI-related projects.  
* Integrate **AI-IRB** regulatory requirements into the documentation lifecycle.  
* Maintain clear traceability from concept through post-implementation.  
* Protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of project documents.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to all individuals involved in producing, reviewing, or managing project-related documentation in the AI-SDLC. Includes focus areas such as Internal, External, and Lifecycle. All documents must adhere to the processes in this SOP to maintain compliance with regulatory, AI-IRB, and corporate governance standards.

## Key Definitions

- **Document**: Any written, graphic, or digital artifact capturing information relevant to AI-SDLC (e.g., requirements, designs).
- **Document Owner**: The individual (or team) responsible for creating and maintaining a specific document.
- **Document Control**: The process of systematic creation, review, approval, distribution, revision, and archival of documents.
- **AI-IRB**: AI Institutional Review Board ensuring compliance with ethical, legal, and safety standards for AI projects.
- **Revision**: Any version update to a document triggered by change requests, new data, or continuous improvements.
- **Repository**: The official location (physical or digital) where documents are stored for version control and retrieval.

## Key Roles

- **AI Document Governance Team**: Oversees the entire document control process, ensures AI-IRB compliance, manages templates, and performs periodic audits.
- **AI-IRB**: Reviews AI-related documentation for ethical, compliance, and safety concerns. Approves or mandates changes before release.
- **Senior Management**: Provides strategic direction. Sponsors any large-scale changes to the document governance framework.
- **Project Sponsor**: Champions the project and ensures document compliance at key milestones.
- **AI-PMO**: Monitors overall project documentation progress, escalates issues, and ensures alignment with organizational standards and budgets.
- **Program/Project Manager**: Ensures the creation, review, and final approval of project documents. Coordinates cross-functional sign-offs.
- **Development**: Authors technical design docs, code architecture docs, integration detail docs, and responds to QA or IRB documentation feedback.
- **Quality Assurance**: Reviews test strategies, test results, and ensures all necessary doc updates are made before gating to next phase.
- **Operations**: Prepares environment configs and deployment records. Reviews final install documents.
- **Technical Support**: Creates user guides, release notes, and training materials. Coordinates user documentation reviews with QA, Dev, and PM.
