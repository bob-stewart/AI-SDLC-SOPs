# Lesson Plan Draft: AI Feature Decommissioning and Model Retirement

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1011-01-AI_AI-Feature-Decommissioning-and-Model-Retirement

## Objective

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to define and formalize the process for **decommissioning AI features** and **retiring AI models** used in the production environment, ensuring minimal disruption to users, compliance with ethical/AI-IRB guidelines, and proper knowledge transfer for potential future reference.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to all SDLC AI-based features and machine learning models that are fully or partially deployed in production and must be disabled, removed, or deprecated from the live environment. It covers. This SOP does not cover the initial development or live operation of AI features; see the relevant SOPs (e.g., SOP-1003-01-AI, SOP-1010-01-AI) for those topics.

## Key Definitions

- **AI Feature**: Any user-facing or internal software functionality powered by machine learning or advanced AI models.
- **AI Model**: A trained machine learning model or neural network used within a feature.
- **Decommission/Retirement**: The formal process of removing an AI model or feature from the production environment and associated workflows.
- **AI-IRB**: A special ethics and compliance review board for AI-based systems.
- **Model Artifacts**: Files, logs, metadata, scripts, and any other items necessary to re-instantiate or audit the AI model.

## Key Roles

- No roles and responsibilities provided.
