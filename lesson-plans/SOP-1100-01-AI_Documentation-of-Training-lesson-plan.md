# Lesson Plan Draft: Documentation of Training

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1100-01-AI_Documentation-of-Training

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the process for creating and maintaining documentation of job-related training for personnel participating in the AI-SDLC (Artificial Intelligence Systems Development Life Cycle), including mandatory AI-IRB compliance requirements as applicable. This procedure ensures that all training records are properly maintained and accessible for audit, regulatory, or operational needs.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to all internal and external training programs that pertain to AI-SDLC activities, especially those subject to AI-IRB regulations. It also includes project-specific training, both client-facing and internally required, that is relevant to the design, development, testing, deployment, or maintenance of AI-driven or AI-related systems at the organization.

## Key Definitions

- **AI-SDLC**: The Systems Development Life Cycle adapted for AI-driven solutions, with AI-IRB oversight where required.
- **AI-IRB**: The AI Institutional Review Board ensuring ethical and regulatory compliance for AI projects.
- **Trainer**: The individual(s) delivering training (internal or external).
- **Training Coordinator**: The person (often in HR or departmental lead) who organizes and tracks training events and records.
- **Project-Specific Training**: Training tied to a defined feature, project, or protocol within the AI-SDLC.
- **External Training**: Training provided by outside entities (seminars, conferences, vendor training, etc.).
- **Internal Training**: Organized in-house training sessions, workshops, or courses on SOPs, AI frameworks, or tools.

## Key Roles

- **Human Resources**: Maintains overall training records, ensures data integrity, and grants authorized access to records.
- **Training Coordinator**: Oversees scheduling, communications, and logistics for training, and ensures documentation is submitted to HR.
- **Line/Department Managers**: Approve attendance at training, verify alignment with job needs, and forward approvals to HR.
- **Employees / Contract Staff**: Request training approval, attend training, submit evidence or certifications of completion to HR.
- **Trainer**: Develop and deliver training content, provide attendance records and materials to the Training Coordinator.
- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Validates that AI-related training meets regulatory and ethical guidelines, especially for sensitive AI modules.
