# Lesson Plan Draft: Development

**SOP Reference:** SOP-1200-01-AI_Development

## Objective

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the process, responsibilities, and controls for designing, implementing, and testing system components during the Development phase of the AI-SDLC. The Development phase ensures all business and technical requirements are satisfied and ready for subsequent Testing, Validation, and Deployment.

## Audience & Applicability

Applies to all AI-related software/product development activities, including prototypes, enhancements, patches, bug fixes, and major releases.

## Key Definitions

- **AI-IRB Liaison**: The individual or committee representative responsible for overseeing compliance with AI risk management, alignment with ethical/regulatory standards, etc.
- **Implementation Unit (IU)**: A distinct chunk of functionality, code, or script that can be developed, tested, and integrated independently, e.g., a class or module.
- **VOB**: Versioned Object Base. Central source control repository that maintains versioned code, documentation, and other development artifacts.

## Key Roles

- **Project Manager**: Orchestrates project tasks, resource planning, timeline updates, and cross-team communication.
- **Development Team Leader**: Oversees coding standards, assignment of Implementation Units (IUs), code review sessions, and ensures developer adherence to technical design.
- **Developer**: Writes, integrates, and unit-tests code for assigned IUs, addresses assigned defects, and updates associated documentation in the VOB.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Reviews deliverables for compliance and completeness, performs acceptance of code prior to QA environment. Tests fixes for defects and ensures test coverage is achieved.
- **Operations**: Prepares or reviews environment configurations, ensures successful builds for integration testing, and readies staging or production as needed.
- **AI-IRB Liaison**: Conducts or coordinates AI risk assessment if new or changed AI-related functionality is introduced, providing sign-off or requiring additional compliance steps.
- **Product Group**: Collaborates on design input, ensures final product meets business and user needs.
